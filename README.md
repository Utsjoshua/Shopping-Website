# Shopping-Website

This project was created as part of my university subjects.
It uses a mix of html, php, css, javascript and images for the photos of items.
This project was originally created on visual studio code with XAMPP for Apache.
The project was also running on the student AWS elastic beans and cloud 9 services during the operation.

To run the code in visual studio code, please install XAMPP.
Then place the folder into where you put the xampp files.
Place the folder into xampp > htdocs.
Open the XAMPP and turn on the Apache.
Then run the index file as you would run a php file.
If you have the php extention on VScode, you can right click and press "Serve Project".
